A simple (one-activity) Android app that uses the SharedPreferences class and the Gson library to store data from a form to a preferences file.

The form consists of three fields (first name, last name, school) and four buttons: Save, Clear, Load, and Delete Persisted Data. 

The Save button saves the data in the form to the file. The Clear button clears the form. The Load button loads data into the form from the file. The Delete Persisted Data button deletes the data in the preferences file.
